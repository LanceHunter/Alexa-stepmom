# Bad Stepmom

Bad Stepmom is an Alexa skill with two primary pieces of functionality.
- She can set reminders, but will only tell you about those reminders when she is launched after the time for the reminder has expired.
- She can define any english word in the Oxford English Dictionary. These definitions are presented in a condescending manner.

She can also accept a wide variety of requests for many other things, but she will always give a snarky denial for any of those requests.

Some examples:

*Alexa tell Bad Stepmom to remind me to get groceries tomorrow.*

**Yea, okay, whatever, sure.**

*Alexa ask Bad Stepmom what movies are playing tonight.*

**Why would I do that?**

*Alexa ask Bad Stepmom to please make a reservation for two at Three Forks next Friday.*

**You have terrible taste and I'm not going to do that.**

*Alexa ask Bad Stepmom to define galvanize.*

**Oh, you need to know about galvanize? Well, I bet you didn't know it is shock or excite (someone) into taking action, or coat (iron or steel) with a protective layer of zinc. And how could you know that it comes from early 19th century (in the sense ‘stimulate by electricity’): from French galvaniser (see Galvani, Luigi). Now consider yourself educated.**
