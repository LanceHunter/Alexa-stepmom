# Alexa Stepmom

Stepmom is an Alexa skill that will attempt to create a full set of features delivered in a snarky, judgmental tone.

Some examples:

*"Stepmom please remind me to get groceries tomorrow."*
**"Fine, if you are going to get so drunk that you forget every simple thing, then I guess I'll have to remind you."**

*Stepmom please tell me what movies are playing tonight.*
**I see that there's a new romantic comedy that opened recently. You remember romance, or have you been single too long?**

*Stepmom please make a reservation for two at Three Forks next Friday.*
**Oh is this a date? Well I'll go ahead and order some wine for when it goes poorly.**

*Stepmom please play my workout playlist.*
**Okay, here's some music for your much-needed exercise.**
